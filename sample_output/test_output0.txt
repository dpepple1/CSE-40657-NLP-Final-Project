Dear Hiring Manager

I was in a position of authority at Intel. It is no secret that I am a great advocate for the rights of people. It is a privilege that I hold, and I am an asset. But I am not an asset, nor am I a good representative of Intel. The questions are from the left, the right, and the home of the beast. I am not an asset, nor a good representative of Intel.

I am in a position of authority at Intel. I am an asset, but I am not an asset. I am not an asset, nor am I an asset.

I am not an asset, nor am I an asset. I am not an asset, nor am I an asset.

I am not an asset, nor am I an asset.

I am not an asset, nor am I an asset. I am not an asset, nor am I an asset.

I am not an asset, nor am I
