Dear Hiring Manager

I am currently looking for a new staff member to join the staff at my business.

I would like to hire a great person to take over my job, but I have yet to find a person to join my office.

I am looking for a manager who can help me with my business, so I can get the best out of my work.

I have a very good understanding of how to get a job and what to do with my work.

I am not looking for a new job to replace my current one.

Thank you for contacting me
