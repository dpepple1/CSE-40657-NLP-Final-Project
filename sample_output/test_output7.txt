Dear Hiring Manager

This is a new season. A new season.

With that, I would like to address the fans who were inspired by our last game.

We were not in the same place last week. The game we played, the game we played, the teams that we have played, and the games we've played. We went through a very difficult stretch last week. We were just playing in a pretty bad situation. The game we played was a great.

I don't know how we got in this situation last week.

It was hard to get through the last game. We had a very difficult stretch last week. We were playing a good team.

I was very happy for that game. I was able to get through it.
I'm glad we won.

It's a good game. It's a great game.

You can thank the players who are really hard to get through.

We are a good team.
