Dear Hiring Manager

I'm a former E-Cap version 3 character and am working on it as a good 3D 1-2-3.

This game is my personal game, I've been a fan of my past games for quite a while and was looking for a way to have a fun time with it was my personal take on the game.

I was curious about how I could make this game but I decided to put it in my own game.

It's a simple 2D action game and I'm trying to make it the game I'm trying to make it.

I think it's the best I've ever made.
